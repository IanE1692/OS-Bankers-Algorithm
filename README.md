# OS-Bankers-Algorithm

This project implements the Bankers ALgoithim to avoid deadlock and allocate resources for proccesses. The source code is provided in the "bankers.cpp" file and includes inlined comments to help read the code. This C++ program reads input from an "input.txt" file and implements the Banker's Algorithm to determine if the system is in a safe state. If the system is in a safe state, it prints the safe sequence of processes. 


To compile and run, use the following:

g++ banker.cpp -o banker
./banker
